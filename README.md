Write a program that prints one line depending of the input : 
- For multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number
- For the multiples of five, print Buzz instead of the number
- For numbers, which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number
- In the other cases, print the number

f : fizzbuzz()

f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2
f(3) = Fizz
f(4) = 4
f(5) = Buzz
f(6) = Fizz
f(7) = 7
f(8) = 8
f(9) = Fizz
f(10) = Buzz
f(11) = 11
f(12) = Fizz
f(13) = 13
f(14) = 14
f(15) = FizzBuzz
f(16) = 16
f(17) = 17
f(18) = Fizz
f(19) = 19
f(20) = Buzz
... etc
